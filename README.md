# The Blackpink Band Website
## [link to the website](https://blackpinkfanweb.herokuapp.com/)
### Overview
- This is a website that I created using front-end design and back-end route handling logic for the feedback and chat features. In this website, the users can check all the albums' information with tracklist and play the songs from the website. There is also feedback page for users to leave comments. All the comments are stored in the backend with a JSON file. In addition, users can also start online live chat with other users who are also online."
